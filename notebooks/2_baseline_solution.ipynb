During my time at F.A., I had at least one poem published in each issue of Resonance. In high school, I was also a member of the staff. But that wasn’t why I loved it. I loved it — and I swear I am not exaggerating here — because I thought the writing in its pages was more beautiful than anything I’d ever read. I was not a happy or popular adolescent, and the emotional stance I adopted toward most of my peers at F.A. might best be described as a defensive crouch. I was scared of my classmates, and I resented them; I could tell they didn’t like me, but I couldn’t figure out why. To the extent that I was able to lift myself out of my own sodden self-loathing to contemplate their inner worlds, I imagined their minds to be filled, like mine, with a whirlwind of criticism and judgment. But, once a year, at the end of the spring semester, I would open my copy of Resonance and be forced to face the unsettling possibility that my classmates were not the shallow bullies I imagined them to be but actual people, with souls.\""
